## Community Scripts

Here are many of the community made scripts to automate many aspects of the game. A lot of them utilise or are companions to other automation tools such as AutoRetainer, visland, Pandora's Box, Automaton, Artisan, or YesAlready. Requirements are generally listed in the description if any are needed.

Many of these were originally posted to [Liza's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/eqw3TpQKyb) or the [Puni.sh Discord](https://discord.gg/Zzrcc8kmvy), and links to the original posts are included in the header comments of each file.
